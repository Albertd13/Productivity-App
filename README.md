# Productivity App

An Android application to improve productivity through scheduling and focused activity time, still a work in progress.

## Current features:
1. Add or remove tasks, with different classifications (deadlines, recurring or scheduled tasks) and options for notifications
2. Set a work-break timed cycle like the Pomodoro technique to focus on work (referred to as Focus Plan in app).

## Features which are still WIP:
1. Using a different calendar to highlight days with deadlines (and number of deadlines if multiple)
2. Directly connect timed tasks (i.e. tasks with specified duration) to the focus plan for convenience.
3. Adjusting colour scheme
4. Adding a home screen to see an overview of the day's/week's progress.
