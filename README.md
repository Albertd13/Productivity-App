# Productivity App

An Android application to improve productivity through scheduling and focused activity time. 

If you dislike doing detailed scheduling with apps like Google Calendar, try using this lightweight offline app to keep yourself on task and remind yourself of important dates. This app also makes it convenient to incorporate breaks into your focus time, using proven methods like the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,length%2C%20separated%20by%20short%20breaks.), or any other work-break cycle that you can customise yourself!

## Current Features:
1. Add or remove tasks, with different classifications (deadlines, recurring or scheduled tasks) and options for notifications
2. Set a work-break timed cycle like the Pomodoro technique to focus on work (referred to as Focus Plan in app).

## Current Features:

## Features still being worked on:
1. Using a different calendar to highlight days with deadlines (and number of deadlines if multiple)
2. Directly connect timed tasks (i.e. tasks with specified duration) to the focus plan for convenience.
3. Dynamic colour theme based on user customisation.
4. Adding a home screen to see an overview of the day's/week's progress.
